                        <p> Hi, my name is Andrea! I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in History and a certificate
                            in Health Informatics. I am currently employed at Austin Regional Clinc as an Epic EMR Specialist. In this
                            role, I provide Epic Ambulatory support to the 24 Austin Regional Clinics, help with provider on-boarding,
                            and participate in system upgrades through analysis, testing, and developing documentation to support workflows
                            and procedures.
                        </p>
                    
                        <p>Outside of work, I like to go hiking with my dog, watching new movies at the Alamo Drafthouse, and volunteering
                            around the community. I am interested in learning to code, and have enrolled in the UT Coding Boot Camp.
                            I am excited about this new opportunity and seeing how much I can learn over the next six months.
                        </p>
