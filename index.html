    <p class="p1"> Hi, my name is Andrea! I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in History and a certificate in Health Informatics.
        I am currently employed at Austin Regional Clinc as an Epic EMR Specialist. In this role, I provide Epic Ambulatory support to the 24 Austin
        Regional Clinics, help with provider on-boarding, and participate in system upgrades through analysis, testing, and developing documentation to support 
        workflows and procedures. 
    </p>

    <p class="p2">Outside of work, I like to go hiking with my dog, watch new movies at the Alamo Drafthouse, and volunteering around the community. I am interested in learning
        to code, and have enrolled in the UT Coding Boot Camp. I am excited about this new opportunity and seeing how much I can learn over the next six months.
